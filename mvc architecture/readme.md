# MVC architecture
* MVC stands for - model, view, controller.
* The word - `seperation of concerns` are divided into 3 parts.
* Model :

<br>
<br>


# Model 
mongoose.model. For now, that's what it is.

<br>

# View
* If I create a website using Node.js
* I mean using `template` and `node.js routing`, if I create a website
* Then that part of the `concern` is called `VIEW`.
* In API, mostly the `view` is absent. Developer don't create view while creating website.

<br>

# Controller
* It is collection of function-module that does logical database operation.
