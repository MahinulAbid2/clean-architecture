# MVC architecture
* MVC stands for - model, view, controller.
* The word - `seperation of concerns` are divided into 3 parts.
* Model :

<br>
<br>


# Model 
mongoose.model. For now, that's what it is.

<br>

# View
* If I create a website using Node.js
* I mean using `template` and `node.js routing`, if I create a website
* Then that part of the `concern` is called `VIEW`.
* In API, mostly the `view` is absent. Developer don't create view while creating website.

<br>

# Controller
* It is collection of `function-module` that does logical database operation.
* It is a collection of function module that will be called in `router`.

<br>
<br>

# Route
* Route is not part of MVC.
* But `Model` is used in `controller`. And then `controller` is called in `router`. <b> That's the flow of MVC </b>
